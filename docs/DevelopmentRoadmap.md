### Remaining Phases to be detailed as development progresses...

## Technical Challenges & Considerations

1. **Real-time Performance**
   - Speech processing may introduce latency
   - Suggestion generation should be asynchronous
   - UI updates need to be efficient

2. **Learning Algorithm Complexity**
   - Start with simple pattern matching and heuristics
   - Consider using pre-trained ML models for advanced features
   - Establish clear metrics for suggestion quality

3. **Context Depth vs. Usability**
   - Too many context levels may confuse users
   - Balance automation with manual control
   - Provide clear visual feedback for context changes

4. **Testing Voice Interaction**
   - Create automated testing for command recognition
   - Establish user testing protocols for voice features
   - Collect metrics on command success rates

## Development Approach

1. **Incremental Implementation**
   - Build features in small, testable increments
   - Maintain working application at all stages
   - Prioritize user-facing improvements

2. **Component Independence**
   - Ensure clean separation between system components
   - Use well-defined interfaces between services
   - Allow components to be developed and tested independently

3. **User-Centered Design**
   - Regularly test features with representative users
   - Collect feedback on voice interaction usability
   - Adjust designs based on real-world usage
