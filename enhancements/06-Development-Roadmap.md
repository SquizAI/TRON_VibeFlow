# Development Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for enhancing PRJCT_MGR with hierarchy organization, dictation context awareness, AI categorization, and advanced features. The roadmap is divided into 6 phases with specific timelines and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Core Hierarchy and Organization Structure (2-3 weeks)

### 1.1 Data Structure Updates (Week 1)
- Update note type definitions to support multi-level hierarchy

### 1.2 Basic UI for Hierarchy (Week 2)
- Build collapsible tree view for Project → Category → Note navigation
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for manual organization
- Create UI for creating new Projects and Categories
- Add breadcrumb navigation to show current location in hierarchy

### 1.3 Testing & Refinement (Week 2-3)
- Test data relationships and hierarchy integrity
- Verify that existing notes integrate properly with new structure
- Ensure performance with larger datasets

## Phase 2: Enhanced Dictation Context Awareness (2-3 weeks)

### 2.1 Dictation Context Management (Week 1)
- Update dictation system to be aware of current context (global, project, category, or note)
- Add visual indicators to show current dictation context
- Create context switching mechanism in UI

### 2.2 Dictation Command Parsing (Week 2)
- Implement basic command parsing in dictation text
- Detect phrases like "create new note", "move to project X"
- Add confirmation UI for recognized commands

### 2.3 Command Feedback System (Week 3)
- Design and implement visual feedback for command execution
- Create error handling and disambiguation UI for unclear commands
- Test with various command phrasing patterns

## Phase 3: AI Categorization & Organization (3-4 weeks)

### 3.1 Content Analysis Framework (Week 1)
- Build text analysis system to extract key topics and entities
- Implement similarity matching against existing categories/projects
- Create confidence scoring for categorization suggestions

### 3.2 AI Suggestion UI (Week 2)
- Design and implement suggestion interface
- Add UI elements for accepting/rejecting suggestions
- Implement manual override controls

### 3.3 Feedback Learning System (Week 3)
- Create system to store user corrections and preferences
- Implement learning algorithm to improve suggestions over time
- Add analytics to track suggestion accuracy

### 3.4 Testing & Tuning (Week 4)
- Test with diverse content types
- Optimize suggestion algorithms
- Fine-tune confidence thresholds

## Phase 4: Advanced Command Processing & Dictation Modes (3-4 weeks)

### 4.1 Command Vocabulary Expansion (Week 1)
- Expand recognized command phrases
- Implement fuzzy matching for command recognition
- Add support for natural language variations

### 4.2 Multi-Item Dictation (Week 2)
- Enhance dictation to recognize multiple notes/tasks in single session
- Implement content splitting based on topic shifts
- Add confirmation UI for content splits

### 4.3 Context-Switching Commands (Week 3)
- Implement commands to change context during dictation
- Add app-wide keyboard shortcuts for dictation control
- Create visual indicators for mode changes

### 4.4 Refinement & Edge Cases (Week 4)
- Handle ambiguity resolution
- Improve error messages and recovery
- Polish overall dictation experience

## Phase 5: Calendar & Dashboard Integration (3-4 weeks)

### 5.1 Date & Time Extraction (Week 1)
- Implement date/time recognition in dictated content
- Add UI for confirming extracted dates
- Create system for associating dates with notes/tasks

### 5.2 Calendar View Implementation (Week 2)
- Build calendar UI integrated with the note system
- Implement filtering and views
- Add drag-and-drop scheduling

### 5.3 Dashboard Development (Week 3)
- Create consolidated dashboard view
- Implement progress tracking and statistics
- Add customization options

### 5.4 Final Integration & Testing (Week 4)
- Connect all systems
- Test end-to-end workflows
- Optimize performance

## Phase 6: Tagging & Cross-Referencing System (2-3 weeks)

### 6.1 Tag System Implementation (Week 1)
- Build tag data structure and storage
- Create UI for manual tag assignment
- Implement tag-based filtering

### 6.2 AI Tag Suggestions (Week 2)
- Enhance AI to suggest relevant tags
- Implement auto-tagging with confidence thresholds
- Add tag management UI

### 6.3 Cross-Reference UI (Week 3)
- Create visualization for related notes/projects
- Implement "See Also" functionality
- Build advanced search incorporating tags

## Development Principles Throughout

### Test-Driven Development
- Write tests before implementing features
- Maintain test coverage for critical paths
- Implement regression testing

### Incremental Deployment
- Release each phase incrementally after testing
- Collect user feedback after each phase
- Be prepared to adjust subsequent phases based on feedback

### Documentation
- Document APIs and data structures as you build
- Create user guides for new features
- Maintain architectural diagrams to prevent design drift

### Performance Monitoring
- Set up performance metrics from the beginning
- Monitor system responsiveness with larger datasets
- Optimize early when patterns of inefficiency emerge
